My Clock
Project description: A small clock app with several different skins.

This is a lib I created a couple of years ago to try some trigonometry concepts I had been working with.
I publish it here per the request of some users.

If you like it, have any questions or find it useful send me a shoutout to my email: dns.gonz@gmail.com
